# Raspberry Pi internet radio with LCD display and Web-Interface

This radio is able to read a playlist file which contains links up to 99 
internet radiostations and play them in order. 

To controll the radio you are able to turn two different potentiometer to adjust 
the volume and channel. You also could use the web interface to change channels. 

When you change channels, a stepper motor will indicate which channel is 
currently playing and the LCD display will show you: the station name, the 
volume, the IP address of the web interface and a logo if available.
